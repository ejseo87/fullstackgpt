XZ Backdoor Research

Summary:
In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an individual using the alias "Jia Tan." The backdoor allows an attacker possessing a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code through OpenSSH on an affected Linux system. This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

Technical Details:
- Vulnerability Impact: The backdoor grants unauthorized remote code execution capabilities to an attacker in possession of a specific Ed448 private key. This poses a significant threat to affected systems.
- Discovery: The backdoor was uncovered by software developer Andres Freund, a PostgreSQL developer employed by Microsoft. Anomalies in CPU usage during SSH sessions and errors flagged by Valgrind prompted his investigation.
- Origins of the Exposure: The insertion of the backdoor was discovered to be part of a roughly three-year campaign by the individual using the alias Jia Tan and others. The campaign involved ascending to a significant position of influence within the XZ Utils project.
- Compromised Versions: The exploited versions of XZ Utils contained compressed test files harboring the malicious code, which remained inactive until they were extracted and deployed. Deployment was contingent on a specific patch of the SSH server, allowing the altered OpenSSH server daemon to load the tampered liblzma library, effectively compromising the system.

Response and Remediation:
- Following the severity of the threat, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a directive to roll back to prior uncontaminated versions of the software. Major Linux vendors like Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian have started implementing these rollbacks.
- GitHub disabled, then later restored, the XZ repository mirrors to curb the spread of the compromised versions.
- Canonical delayed the beta release of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS to perform a thorough rebuild of the packages to mitigate potential risks.

Repercussions and Reflections:
- The incident has reignited conversations about the reliance on unpaid volunteers for maintaining critical infrastructure, highlighting the potential disaster that could have ensued had the backdoor gone undetected.
- This case serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in digital infrastructures and the continuous need for vigilance in cybersecurity practices.
