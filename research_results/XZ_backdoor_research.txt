### XZ Backdoor (CVE-2024-3094)

In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name "Jia Tan". The backdoor allows an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code through OpenSSH on the affected Linux system. This issue has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number CVE-2024-3094 and has been given a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery, the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on March 29, 2024.

### Technical Details

- **Affected Versions**: XZ Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1.
- **Impact**: The backdoor allows remote code execution on systems running affected versions of the xz utility.
- **Vulnerability Type**: Supply chain attack, where malicious code was introduced into the software during the build process.
- **Discovery**: The vulnerability was discovered by Andres Freund, a Microsoft software developer.

### Background on XZ Utils

XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. It uses the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) for compression and decompression.

### Conclusion

The XZ backdoor represents a significant security risk for systems using the affected versions of the XZ Utils library. Users are advised to update to secure versions and monitor for any signs of exploitation.
