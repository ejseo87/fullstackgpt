       "'[INST] What is the meaning of potato[/INST]A potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the Solanum tuberosum species. It is native to the Andean region of South America and is a major food source worldwide. Potatoes are usually grown as an underground, bulbous structure (the tuber) and are a popular ingredient in many dishes due to their versatility, nutritional value, and neutral flavor. They can be boiled, baked, fried, or mashed and are often served as a side dish or used in main courses, salads, and snacks. Potatoes are rich in carbohydrates, fiber, vitamin C, and potassium.'"
